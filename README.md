# Mobahnes (مبحنص)
This is a library to simplify and collect the algorithms and models of semantic (mainly vector search) search for arabic language fom the simplest to most coplex (counting, probability and LLM)
*note: "Mobahnes" is a built up (Naht) word in arabic made from Researcher (baheth) and Documents (Nosos).*
*ملاحظة كلمة مبحنص هي اشتقاق من نحت ابتكرته أصله بحنص أي باحث نصّي ثم اشتققت منه اسم "مُفتَعِل" من الرباعي فصار مبحنصًا*

I thing I will not complete this project after finding the [text distance library](https://github.com/life4/textdistance/tree/master) becasue it is excactly what I wanted to do and more So if someone could make a wrapper on it to serve the Arabic language my job idea will be done
